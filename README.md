The AI-Powered Poultry Health Monitor is an innovative machine learning project focused on automating the detection and classification of chicken diseases. This end-to-end solution leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze images of chickens and identify potential health issues.

Key features of the project include:

    Image-based disease detection for chickens
    Deep learning model for accurate classification
    Streamlined data pipeline for processing and analysis
    Web application interface for easy use by farmers or veterinarians
    Cloud deployment capabilities for scalability

The project demonstrates a complete workflow from data preparation to model deployment, incorporating best practices in machine learning operations (MLOps). It utilizes technologies such as TensorFlow, DVC (Data Version Control), and MLflow for efficient model development and management.

This solution aims to revolutionize poultry farming by providing early disease detection, potentially reducing economic losses and improving overall flock health management.
